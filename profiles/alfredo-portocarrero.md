## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alfredo Portocarrero

I'm a graduate student from the National University of Engineering with a Bachelors in Systems Engineering.
My main focus is software engineering, with the goal of becoming a software architect. During my time in college, I have been envolved in learning and teaching about software engineering, and currently I'm working at NOVATRONIC. The current stack I am using consists of Java EE 7, AngularJS, PostgreSQL/Oracle and Hibernate.
  
I'm currently learning about distributed systems and microservices with Spring Boot, my go-to book for has been Designing Data-Intensive Applications and for Spring Boot I've been following the Spring Devs channel on YT.
  
The thing I love the most about software engineering is that there's always something new to learn and its community.
